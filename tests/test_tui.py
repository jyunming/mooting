"""The full-screen session, driven headlessly.

Textual ships a pilot that runs the real app with a virtual terminal, so there is
no excuse for shipping this unexecuted -- which is exactly what happened to the
prompt_toolkit path, claimed for three turns before anything ran it.

These drive real keystrokes through the real widgets and assert on the board
afterwards: typing posts, @ directs, /approve rules, and a work topic shows its
tasks. What they cannot check is whether it *looks* right in a terminal.
