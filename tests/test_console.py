"""The interactive prompt, driven headlessly.

Every earlier smoke test piped stdin, which takes the plain `input()` fallback --
so the prompt_toolkit path, the thing that makes replying interactively work at
all, had never once run. prompt_toolkit ships a pipe input and a dummy output
precisely so an app can be exercised without a terminal, and that is what these
do: real PromptSession, real key handling, real completer.

This does not prove it *looks* right in a terminal. It proves the code path runs,
the keys land, and the completions are the ones a person would expect.
