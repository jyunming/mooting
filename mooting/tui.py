"""`mooting tui` -- one screen where the council talks and the team works.

The REPL (`mooting console`) is a scrolling log: fine for a conversation, poor for
work, where "what is every seat doing and where has each task got to" is a
*state* question and a log answers it badly. This is the same board with the
state made visible -- transcript, seats, tasks and proposals side by side, and
one input that both talks and rules.

## It is a view, not a second application

Every command still goes through `Console.handle()`. The TUI only swaps where
output lands (`Console.emit`) and how long-running work is started. Two dispatch
paths would drift within a week, and then `/approve` would mean something subtly
different depending on which surface you were sitting in.

## Threading, which the REPL got away with and this cannot

The REPL runs a poller thread and a supervisor thread that both `print()`.
Textual owns the event loop and its widgets are not thread-safe, so:

* polling is a `set_interval` on the app, not a thread;
* the supervisor runs as a Textual **worker** on Textual's own loop -- the
  drivers are already async, so `asyncio.run()` is not just unnecessary here, it
  would refuse to start inside a running loop;
* the UI and the supervisor hold **separate** `Store` connections, so a slow
  query behind the table redraw cannot sit on the write lock while a seat is
  trying to post.

That last point is only safe because no `tx()` block ever awaits. See `Store.tx`.
