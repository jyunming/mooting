-- Mooting: cross-vendor agent council.
--
-- Design note: this file IS the protocol. Everything else (MCP server, supervisor,
-- web UI) is a view onto these tables. If an agent CLI dies, or a driver flakes, or
-- the supervisor is not running at all, the board is still here and a human or an
-- agent can still read it and move the topic forward. That is the invariant:
--   the board is the substrate, the supervisor is only an accelerator.
