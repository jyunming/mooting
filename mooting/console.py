"""`mooting console` -- one terminal where the whole council is visible, and where
you answer when it asks you something.

## Why this is not just a log tail

A council that can @ you is useless if answering is awkward. Two things make it
work, and both are load-bearing rather than polish:

**Printing must not mangle what you are typing.** A background poller writing to
stdout while you compose an answer destroys the line you are on. `prompt_toolkit`'s
`patch_stdout` puts arriving messages *above* a stable prompt, so you can be
half-way through a sentence when three agents reply and lose nothing. Without it,
"reply interactively" is a lie. (There is a plain `input()` fallback if
prompt_toolkit is missing; it works, but it interleaves badly.)

**A question addressed to you must be impossible to miss.** Agents @ you when they
have hit something only you know -- where a file lives, which of two readings you
meant. That arrives in the same stream as everything else, so it is rendered
differently, counted in the toolbar, and repeated when the council stops.

## What answering does

Typing plain text posts as you and **discharges every question outstanding against
you** -- because answering in prose is how people actually reply, and requiring a
special "answer" gesture would leave stale asks forever. Your interjections never
spend an agent's metered turn.

## Two gestures that are deliberately not chat

`/approve` and `/reject` close a proposal. That is the one power agents do not
have, and it should not look like just another message. `/effort` retunes how hard
the whole council thinks -- the brainstorming dial: go wide and cheap, then think
deep on the branch worth it.
