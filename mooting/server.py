"""`mooting serve` — the board, over HTTP, for clients that are not a terminal.

Milestone B1 of docs/REMOTE.md: read the board and say things to it. Rulings are
deliberately **not** here yet, and neither is driving the council — those come
once the read path has proved itself, because a ruling is the one action that
cannot be undone and it should not be the first thing a new transport learns.

Two design notes worth knowing before changing anything here.

**The event stream is Server-Sent Events, not a websocket.** The board already
keeps a monotonic event cursor, so resuming is just "everything after id N" --
the server takes that from `Last-Event-ID` or `?since=`, whichever the client
sends. A websocket would need the same reconnect logic written by hand on both
ends to arrive in the same place. Actions are ordinary POSTs; nothing needs a
socket. (The bundled page uses `fetch` rather than `EventSource`, because
`EventSource` cannot send an Authorization header and the token belongs in one.)

**Identity is the fence, not a feature.** `Store.decide` refuses a non-human
because locally the caller's identity comes from the operating system. Over a
socket there is no operating system to ask, so whoever holds the token *is* that
seat. That is why the token is required on every request, is never read from a
query string (they land in logs and browser history), and why the server binds
to loopback unless somebody says otherwise in as many words.
