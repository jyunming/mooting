"""Take the meeting out of the board.

A council is only worth convening if what it decided outlives the terminal it
happened in. This renders a topic as markdown you can commit, paste into a PR, or
hand to whoever was not in the room.

Two things it deliberately does *not* do:

**It does not summarise.** Minutes that paraphrase are minutes you have to
distrust, and there is no way to check them without the transcript you no longer
have. Every position appears in the words the seat used. What is dropped is only
scaffolding -- round markers, wake failures, pause notices -- which is noise about
the machinery rather than anything anyone said.

**It does not decide what the conclusion was.** The conclusion is whatever a human
approved, which the board already records. If nothing was approved the minutes say
so, rather than promoting the last confident-sounding paragraph.
