"""SQLite-backed council board.

Every process in Mooting -- the MCP server each agent CLI spawns for itself, the
supervisor, the human UI -- talks to one file through this module. There is no
server-of-record and no daemon requirement: if nothing else is running, the board
is still readable and writable, which is what lets a failed wake degrade to
catch-up-on-next-turn instead of deadlocking a topic.

Encoding: every text boundary here is pinned to UTF-8 explicitly rather than
left to the platform default. A console that decodes a UTF-8 pipe as something
else produces garbled text that reads like protocol corruption, and diagnosing
that costs a day.
