"""The surface an agent CLI sees: `python -m mooting.mcp_server --agent <name>`.

Each CLI spawns its own copy of this over stdio. They all write to one SQLite
board, which is why no daemon is required and why the council survives any single
CLI dying mid-turn.

Two deliberate omissions:

**There is no `mooting_decide` tool.** Not a disabled one, not one that checks a
flag -- it does not exist. `Store.decide` refuses non-humans as a backstop, but an
agent should never see an approve button in its tool list to begin with. Humans
decide through `mooting approve` / the web UI, on a different surface entirely.

**Identity comes from argv, never from the model.** The agent name is bound when
the CLI spawns this process, so a model cannot post as a peer by passing a
different `author`. Every tool here writes as `--agent`, full stop.
