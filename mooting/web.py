"""`mooting serve --web` — the whole session, in a browser.

Milestone A of docs/REMOTE.md. `textual-serve` runs a Textual app on this
machine and renders it over a websocket, so the browser gets the real session:
the transcript, the seat panel, the input that rules on proposals. Nothing is
reimplemented, which is the entire appeal.

Two things it does not do, and both matter more than the serving:

**It has no authentication.** Whoever reaches the port gets a live session and
can approve plans, grant execute capability and conclude meetings, because
`Store.decide` is an identity check and there is no identity here at all. So
this binds loopback and refuses anything else unless told twice.

**It launches one app per connection.** Two viewers are two `mooting tui`
processes on one board. The board tolerates that -- WAL, one writer at a time --
but both can press Run, and the drive lock below is what stops two supervisors
waking every seat twice on one budget.
