# Driving a council from somewhere else

Four ways to reach a council you are not sitting in front of. All four work
today: SSH needs nothing extra; a browser tab, an HTTP API, and a Telegram
chat all run on top of one board server. In every one of them the hard part is
never the transport — it is that sign-off is enforced by identity, and
a remote caller has none until you give them one.

---

## Choosing

| You want | Do this |
|---|---|
| Set up a council from your laptop, on a machine that has the CLIs | SSH — works today, see below |
| Watch a round from a phone on your own network | Browser (`mooting serve --web`), behind an SSH tunnel |
| Two people in one council, or a client that is not a terminal | HTTP + events (`mooting serve`) |
| A council that keeps running while nobody watches | HTTP + events or Telegram — both own a supervisor |
| To run a council from your phone, in a group, with other people | Telegram — `mooting telegram` |

---

## Using it

### SSH

The board is a plain SQLite file and nothing needs a daemon, so a shell on the
machine is a complete interface:

```bash
ssh box "cd project && mooting topic new reno \
    --title 'Renovation in Leuven' --brief 'Renovation in Leuven' \
    --seats Kevin,Sam,Santa,you"
ssh box "cd project && mooting topic agenda reno \
    'what budget; which rooms; heat pump or not'"
ssh box "cd project && mooting run reno"
```

`mooting console` is the line-based session for exactly this: `mooting tui`
wants a real terminal, `console` does not, and both drive the same board through
the same dispatch.

**What SSH does not give you:** a session two people can watch at once, a phone,
or anything that survives the connection dropping mid-round.

> **Do not** put the board on OneDrive, Dropbox or an SMB share to "sync" it.
> SQLite's locking assumes a real filesystem; cloud-sync clients copy files out
> from under open handles, and the failure mode is a corrupt board, not an
> error. If two machines must reach one board, they need a process in front of
> it — see HTTP + events, below.

### Browser — `mooting serve --web`

```bash
mooting serve --web
```

Runs the real session in a browser through `textual-serve` — the transcript,
the seat panel, and the input that decides. Nothing is reimplemented.

Whoever reaches that port **is** the human sitting there: they can approve
plans, grant execute capability, and conclude meetings. `textual-serve` has no
authentication of its own, so bind to `127.0.0.1` and reach it through an SSH
tunnel, or put it behind a reverse proxy that authenticates. A non-loopback
bind is refused outright unless you also pass `--allow-remote`.

### HTTP + events — `mooting serve`

```bash
pip install 'mooting[serve]'
mooting serve
```

One process owns the board and the supervisor; a TUI, a web page, a phone, or
a script all talk to it the same way.

Every route is under `/api`. This table is the server's own routing table, not
a plan: a path that is not here does not answer.

| | |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/topics`, `GET /api/topics/{slug}` | what exists, and its agenda |
| `PATCH /api/topics/{slug}` | agenda, mode, manager, rounds, effort |
| `POST /api/topics/{slug}/messages` | say something, or answer a question |
| `POST /api/topics/{slug}/run` · `/stop` | drive the council |
| `GET /api/proposals/{id}` | one proposal in full, with its votes |
| `POST /api/proposals/{id}/decide` | sign-off — people's seats only |
| `GET /api/stream` | the event stream, as Server-Sent Events; resumes from `Last-Event-ID` or `?since=`, misses nothing |
| `GET /api/events?since=N` | the same events by polling, for a client that cannot hold a connection |

**Not here:** opening a topic and fetching minutes have no route. Both exist at
the terminal (`mooting topic new`, `mooting minutes`) and neither has been
needed remotely yet -- said plainly rather than listed as though they answered.

`mooting serve --grant <seat>` issues a bearer token for a human seat (never
send it as a query string — it ends up in logs). Every decision carries the seat
whose token made it.

### Telegram — `mooting telegram`

A council in a Telegram chat, with buttons for sign-off and the same commands
as the terminal session.

#### Setting it up

**1. Make a bot.** In Telegram, message **@BotFather** and send `/newbot`. It
asks for a display name, then a username ending in `bot`, and replies with a
token like `8123456789:AAF...`. Treat it as a password.

**2. Install, and seat a council.**

```bash
pip install 'mooting[telegram]'
cd your-project
mooting setup
```

**3. Start the bot.** The token is needed this once; it is remembered after
Telegram accepts it.

```bash
mooting telegram --token 8123456789:AAF...
```

Leave it running. It prints a one-time pairing code:

```
  menu    10 commands registered — type / in the chat to see them
  pair    send  /pair 9f2c1a  to the bot to claim the first seat
```

**4. Pair yourself.** Send that line to your bot:

```
/pair 9f2c1a
```

It replies with the seat you speak as and this chat's id.

**Adding the bot to another room later.** The bot answers only in rooms it
knows: one named with `--chat`, or one where somebody has already been approved.
An unknown group is ignored, and the terminal says which chat it ignored. To
open a new room, print a code and send it from the account that should hold the
seat:

```bash
mooting claim                 # prints:  /pair a1b2c3
```

Sending that in the new group binds your chat account to the seat, makes you the
host of that room, and makes the room known. It is good once, for fifteen
minutes. Reading it requires the machine the board lives on, which is the point:
every other way of saying who owns a board -- a name passed to the command, being
first to pair, creating the group -- is something anybody can produce.

**In a group, turn Group Privacy off first.** Telegram gives a new bot privacy
mode by default, and a bot in that mode receives only commands and replies to
its own messages. Every command still works, and plain talk — which is how you
post to the council — never reaches it, silently. In @BotFather: `/mybots` →
your bot → *Bot Settings* → *Group Privacy* → *Turn off*, then remove the bot
from the group and add it again, because the setting is read when it joins. A
one-to-one chat with the bot is unaffected.

**5. Lock it to that room.** Stop the bot, start it again with the id — no
token, it is remembered:

```bash
mooting telegram --chat -1001234567890
```

Without `--chat` the bot answers **anywhere it is added**, which hands that room
your subscriptions. The id is remembered too, so from now on it is just
`mooting telegram`.

**6. Hold a council.** Type `/` for the commands.

```
/topic new should we cap webhook retries?
/topic agenda cap the retries; full or partial jitter
/run
```

Plain messages post as you. `@Santa what does the gateway do today?` puts a
question to one seat and the others wait for the answer.

#### Once it is running

- `/topics` lists every council as buttons, one per row, with the one this chat
  is on marked. Tap another and the room moves to it. The same list appears if
  you send anything while the chat is not on a topic yet, so a slug never has to
  be typed from memory on a phone. `/topic new`, `/topic agenda` and the rest
  still mean what they always did.
- A proposal arrives with **Approve / Reject** buttons. The reason is the reply
  it asks you for, and the button carries the proposal id, so a sign-off cannot
  land on the wrong one.
- That happens for proposals opened **while the bot is running** — the chat picks
  up from the board's head and never replays. `/proposals 7` fetches any proposal
  by number, buttons included, whenever it was opened.
- `/minutes` sends the write-up as a file; `/minutes decisions` returns the
  decisions as text; `/conclude` ends the meeting and delivers both.
- Send anything to the chat -- a file, a photo, a voice note -- and it is
  attached to the topic. Text, PDF and Word go into every seat's next prompt;
  anything else the seats get by name and path only.
- `/topic agenda`, `/rounds`, `/effort`, `/seats` — the same commands as the
  terminal session, because it is the same dispatch behind them.

#### Adding other people

Once you are paired, approving happens in the chat — no terminal:

```
them:  /pair
bot:   You are not paired here. Request 2 is waiting for a member to approve it.
you:   /pair approve 2
bot:   A Colleague now speaks as AColleague.
```

`/pair list` shows what is waiting; `/pair deny <id>` refuses. This part goes
beyond openclaw, which approves only from the shell.

The seat is derived from their own display name rather than invented, and it is
always a **human** seat: pairing a person onto an agent seat would let them
speak as one, and put a non-human name against something only a human may do.

Approval is **per chat** — being trusted in one council is not being trusted in
another — and `mooting pair --approve <id> --seat <s>` still works from the
shell, which is how you recover if you lose access to the chat.
